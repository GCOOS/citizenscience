1,29.505354,-94.826546,"GBF's Water Monitoring Team","A group of volunteers that collect monthly water quality data around Galveston Bay.","GBF's Water Monitoring Team (WMT) was established in February 2012 as a group within the statewide Texas Stream Team program. The team consists of about 35 volunteers who conduct monthly sampling on surface waters along the shoreline of Galveston Bay and Clear Lake.  Testing includes field observations, and physical and chemical analyses.","The WMT assists with the establishment of local baseline and trend data; helps to augment professional sampling conducted in the area; contributes to the education of local citizens through their own certification process and through their public outreach influence while out sampling; and helps in local decision-making processes.","The data collected by GBF's WMT have a very high level of quality control and quality assurance according to an EPA-approved Quality Assurance Project Plan.","GBF partners with many types of landowners to gain access to the waters of Galveston Bay and Clear Lake.",,http://galvbay.org/watermonitors/,data/MonitoringTeam/1 - GBFs Water Monitoring Team.jpg
2,29.272506,-94.881102,"Sweetwater Nature Preserve","This monitoring site is located at one of GBF's many beautiful properties.","The Galveston Bay Foundation owns and manages roughly 4000 acres of land, much of it with beautiful access to the bay. Sweetwater Preserve is one of GBF's properties. Here, GBF works to restore native habitat, track bird usage, and monitor water quality.","The volunteer who monitors water quality biweekly at the Sweetwater Nature Preserve began in November of 2013.",,,,,data/MonitoringTeam/2 - Sweetwater.jpg
3,29.387027,-94.874629,"Texas City Dike","This ecologically significant structure makes for a wonderful water monitoring location.","The Texas City Dike is owned by the City of Texas City, a very industrialized portion of Galveston Bay that is well known for its many petroleum and petrochemical refineries.","The Dike protects this low-lying industrial zone and the residential areas surrounding it from sedimentation and potential water surges from hurricanes and large storms.","The volunteer at this location began collecting monthly water quality samples in July of 2012. She collects additional samples to test for Enterococci bacteria.",,,,data/MonitoringTeam/3 - Texas City Dike.jpg
4,29.478481,-94.919725,"6th Street in San Leon","A few of the WMT volunteers conduct their water quality testing from their own personal piers.","This portion of the bay is highly residential; most of the waterfront properties in this area are owned by individual homeowners. At times, the Galveston Bay shoreline can only be accessed through an agreement with homeowners or a WMT volunteer that owns a waterfront home, such as this site.","The volunteer monitoring this location began collecting biweekly samples in October of 2012. This volunteer collects additional samples to test for Enterococci bacteria.",,,,,data/MonitoringTeam/4 - San Leon.jpg
5,29.552070,-95.052056,"Marina Del Sol","GBF regularly partners with local marinas to collect water quality samples.","Clear Lake has one of the highest concentrations of privately owned marinas in the nation. Therefore, GBF and the volunteers within the WMT partner frequently with local marinas to gain access to the water for sampling. In the case of Marina Del Sol, the marina manager is the main WMT volunteer!","In the summer of 2013, Marina Del Sol and a few of their trained tenants participated in a research study conducted by GBF that focused on bacteria concentrations in the marina's surface waters.","The main volunteer at Marina Del Sol was one of the first to join the WMT and has consistently monitored the water in the marina since September of 2012.",,,,data/MonitoringTeam/5 - Marina del Sol.jpg
6,29.713048,-94.993137,"Bayland Park","Waterfront parks, such as this one owned by the City of Baytown, are very accessible and are therefore popular water monitoring sites.","Bayland Park is owned by the City of Baytown. This area of Galveston Bay has a large concentration of inaccessible waterfront properties (homes and industry), which makes this park a great location for water monitoring. ","The volunteer at Bayland Park began conducting monthly water quality testing in March of 2013.",,,,,data/MonitoringTeam/6 - Bayland Park.jpg
7,29.525213,-94.765333,"Candy Cain Abshier Wildlife Management Area","This state-owned property has very easy and beautiful access to the bay.","Much of the land to the east of Galveston Bay is open and undeveloped. Candy Cain Abshier Wildlife Management Area (WMA) is one such tract of land managed by Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD). Candy Cain Abshier WMA is a popular location for migratory birds and for the birders who track them.","GBF partners with TPWD along this shoreline for restoration projects as well.","This location is new to the WMT and has not yet been monitored. Future bacteria sampling will allow us to compare potential impacts from wildlife versus human sources, since most current WMT sites are in highly developed areas.",,,,data/MonitoringTeam/7 - Candy Cain.jpg
8,29.482082,-94.605146,"Stingaree Restaurant","A restaurant that offers great views of the Intracoastal Waterway and the marshland beyond, and is a prime water quality monitoring location.","This portion of Galveston Bay is relatively undeveloped and is home to large expanses of salt marsh. This is very ecologically beneficial, but difficult to gain access to on foot, which is why GBF commonly partners with easily accessible waterfront restaurants such as Stingaree.","The volunteer at this location has been collecting water quality samples since July of 2013.",,,,,data/MonitoringTeam/8 - Stingaree.jpg
