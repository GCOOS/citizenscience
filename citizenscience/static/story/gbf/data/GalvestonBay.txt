- Is it possible to have a point on the storytelling map tour actually be a geographic area? We would like to use the shortlist style of storytelling map and in the example one of the points was actually an area. If this is possible, we would like point number 1 in the General document and point number 1 in the Volunteer document to be an area (of Galveston Bay as a whole â€“ they can both be the same geographic area). They currently are listed as points, with a lat and long associated with them if it is not possible to have them displayed as the geographic area.


1,29.505354,-94.826546,Galveston Bay,"A rich, productive estuary that affects local economy through commercial fishing and oyster harvesting, the transportation of goods, and nature tourism.","Galveston Bay is a local and national treasure. It is the second most productive bay in the United States, producing one-third of Texas' recreational and commercial harvests of seafood. It covers about 600 square miles, is 30 miles long by 17 miles wide, and averages seven to nine feet deep. The western shore is highly developed with commercial, residential, and industrial sites, while the eastern shore is sparsely developed and contains large tracts of nature preserves. Galveston Bay is a key economic asset due to the access it provides to the second busiest port in the U.S. via the Gulf of Mexico and the Houston Ship Channel."
